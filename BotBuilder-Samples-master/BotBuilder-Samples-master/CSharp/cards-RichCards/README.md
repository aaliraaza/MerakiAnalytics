### Prerequisites

The minimum prerequisites to run this sample are:
* The latest update of Visual Studio 2015. You can download the community version [here](http://www.visualstudio.com) for free.
* The Bot Framework Emulator. To install the Bot Framework Emulator, download it from [here](https://emulator.botframework.com/). Please refer to [this documentation article](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator/wiki/Getting-Started) to know more about the Bot Framework Emulator.

### Code Highlights

Many messaging channels provide the ability to attach richer objects. The Bot Framework has the ability to render rich cards as attachments. There are several types of cards supported: Hero Card, Thumbnail Card, Receipt Card, Sign-In Card, Animation Card, Video Card and Audio Card. Once the desired Card type is selected, it is mapped into an `Attachment` data structure. Check out the key code located in the [CardsDialog](CardsDialog.cs#L46-L51) class where the `message.Attachments` property of the message activity is populated with a card attachment.

````C#
public async Task DisplaySelectedCard(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<string> result)
{
    var selectedCard = await result;

    var message = context.MakeMessage();

    var attachment = GetSelectedCard(selectedCard);
    message.Attachments.Add(attachment);

    await context.PostAsync(message);

    context.Wait(this.MessageReceivedAsync);
}
````

#### Hero Card

The Hero card is a multipurpose card; it primarily hosts a single large image, a button, and a "tap action", along with text content to display on the card. Check out the `GetHeroCard` method in the [CardsDialog](CardsDialog.cs#L80-L92) class for a Hero Card sample.

````C#
private static Attachment GetHeroCard()
{
    var heroCard = new HeroCard
    {
        Title = "BotFramework Hero Card",
        Subtitle = "Your bots — wherever your users are talking",
        Text = "Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with your users naturally wherever they are, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services.",
        Images = new List<CardImage> { new CardImage("https://sec.ch9.ms/ch9/7ff5/e07cfef0-aa3b-40bb-9baa-7c9ef8ff7ff5/buildreactionbotframework_960.jpg") },
        Buttons = new List<CardAction> { new CardAction(ActionTypes.OpenUrl, "Get Started", value: "https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/") }
    };

    return heroCard.ToAttachment();
}
````

#### Thumbnail Card
The Thumbnail card is a multipurpose card; it primarily hosts a single small image, a button, and a "tap action", along with text content to display on the card. Check out the `GetThumbnailCard` method in the [CardsDialog](CardsDialog.cs#L94-L106) class for a Thumbnail Card sample.

````C#
private static Attachment GetThumbnailCard()
{
    var heroCard = new ThumbnailCard
    {
        Title = "BotFramework Thumbnail Card",
        Subtitle = "Your bots — wherever your users are talking",
        Text = "Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with your users naturally wherever they are, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services.",
        Images = new List<CardImage> { new CardImage("https://sec.ch9.ms/ch9/7ff5/e07cfef0-aa3b-40bb-9baa-7c9ef8ff7ff5/buildreactionbotframework_960.jpg") },
        Buttons = new List<CardAction> { new CardAction(ActionTypes.OpenUrl, "Get Started", value: "https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/") }
    };

    return heroCard.ToAttachment();
}
````

#### Receipt Card
The receipt card allows the Bot to present a receipt to the user. Check out the `GetReceiptCard` method in the [CardsDialog](CardsDialog.cs#L108-L132) class for a Receipt Card sample.

````C#
private static Attachment GetReceiptCard()
{
    var receiptCard = new ReceiptCard
    {
        Title = "John Doe",
        Facts = new List<Fact> { new Fact("Order Number", "1234"), new Fact("Payment Method", "VISA 5555-****") },
        Items = new List<ReceiptItem>
        {
            new ReceiptItem("Data Transfer", price: "$ 38.45", quantity: "368", image: new CardImage(url: "https://github.com/amido/azure-vector-icons/raw/master/renders/traffic-manager.png")),
            new ReceiptItem("App Service", price: "$ 45.00", quantity: "720", image: new CardImage(url: "https://github.com/amido/azure-vector-icons/raw/master/renders/cloud-service.png")),
        },
        Tax = "$ 7.50",
        Total = "$ 90.95",
        Buttons = new List<CardAction>
        {
            new CardAction(
                ActionTypes.OpenUrl,
                "More information",
                "https://account.windowsazure.com/content/6.10.1.38-.8225.160809-1618/aux-pre/images/offer-icon-freetrial.png",
                "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/")
        }
    };

    return receiptCard.ToAttachment();
}
````

#### Sign-In Card
The Sign-In card is a card representing a request to sign in the user. Check out the `GetSigninCard` method in the [CardsDialog](CardsDialog.cs#L134-L143) class for a Sign-In Card sample.

> Note: The sign in card can be used to initiate an authentication flow which is beyond this sample. For a complete authentication flow sample take a look at [AuthBot](https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/AuthBot).

````C#
private static Attachment GetSigninCard()
{
    var signinCard = new SigninCard
    {
        Text = "BotFramework Sign-in Card",
        Buttons = new List<CardAction> { new CardAction(ActionTypes.Signin, "Sign-in", value: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/") }
    };

    return signinCard.ToAttachment();
}
````

#### Animation Card
The Animation card is a card that’s capable of playing animated GIFs or short videos. Check out the `GetAnimationCard` method in the [CardsDialog](CardsDialog.cs#L145-L165) class for an Animation Card sample.

````C#
private static Attachment GetAnimationCard()
{
    var animationCard = new AnimationCard
    {
        Title = "Microsoft Bot Framework",
        Subtitle = "Animation Card",
        Image = new ThumbnailUrl
        {
            Url = "https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/images/faq-overview/botframework_overview_july.png"
        },
        Media = new List<MediaUrl>

            {
                Url = "http://i.giphy.com/Ki55RUbOV5njy.gif"
            }
